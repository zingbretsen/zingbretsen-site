    <p>
      Professional nerd, foodie, and photographer. I am a data scientist with a
      passion for problem solving. Currently working at the intersection of Data
      Science, DevOps, and App Development.

    <p>
      {' '}
      I have worked in both academia and industry, and I have viewed my primary
      role in both to have been to enable others to efficiently do their work.

    <p>
      {' '}
      Python was the first programming language I loved, and R has become a
      relatively new favorite. I believe that Vim, Git, and Docker give you
      superpowers.
