## Pipes

This post is about the forward-pipe from the magrittr package in R. If you have worked in a shell in a *nix system, you are likely already familiar with pipes, but for the uninitiated here's the scoop:

Pipes essentially allow you to take the output of one operation and "pipe" it into the next operation. This makes the code read more closely to how you think about the execution than does the other way of writing code: nesting functions inside each other.

The tidyverse uses pipes extensively, and is one of the reasons that tidy code is so readable. When you source in dplyr, it automatically exports one pipe from the magrittr package, the forward-pipe (`%>%`).

### Forward-Pipe Operator

`%>%` is the forward-pipe operator. If you import `dplyr`, it automatically imports this pipe (and only this pipe) from `magrittr`. It takes the result from the lefthand side (often abbreviated `lhs`) and inserts it into the righthand side (`rhs`) function as the *first argument*.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
lhs %>% rhs

## Is equivalent to
rhs(lhs)
```


The following code will take the `mtcars` dataset, `filter` it, `select` a subset of columns, and then display the first 6 items (with `head`). However, because of the nested function calls, it is not immediately obvious in what order the functions are run and what is the state of the dataset at each step:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

head(select(filter(mtcars, cyl >= 4), mpg, cyl))
```

Using pipes, we can untangle that mess and it becomes clear what the intended order is. As we stated before, we take the `mtcars` dataset, `filter` it, `select` a couple of columns, and then pipe it into `head`. Now the code actually reads like what we intended from the start:

```{r}
mtcars %>% filter(cyl >= 4) %>% select(mpg, cyl) %>% head()
```

An important limitation is that each function in our pipe must accept the data as the *first* argument. Most of the `tidyverse` functions follow this convention, but not all R functions do. If you need to pass the data as a *different* argument, you can use `.`.

In this fairly contrived example, if we want to find which rows contain the string "Mazda", we can use one of the functions from the `grep` family. Unfortunately for our piping, `grep` functions take the *pattern* you are searching for as the first argument and the strings you are searching as the second. This would not work if we naively pipe the output from `row.names` into `grep` because we would be passing our character vector into the `pattern` argument and "Mazda" in as `x` (the vector we want to search within).

For this situation, we can change which argument gets the data by using `.`--This lets us specify that `grep` should take the vector passed in from the previous step as the second argument, and "Mazda" as the first:

```{r}
indices <- mtcars %>% row.names() %>% grep("Mazda", .)
mtcars[indices,]
```

We can even take this a step further. Rather than saving the indices and using them in a separate step, we can once again using our friend the `.` thusly:
```{r}
mtcars %>% row.names() %>% grep("Mazda", .) %>% mtcars[.,]
```
`mtcars` is not a function, and so we cannot just pipe data into it. We *can*, however, index into it using the `.`. In your own endeavors, use your best judgment about whether using this kind of strategy helps or hurts the readability of your code.

The `.` cannot, unfortunately, save us from some other common problems. There are situations where you don't want to pass the whole input into the `rhs` function. This example of taking the mean of the `mpg` column will fail because the pipe will still pass the data into the first argument *in addition to* passing the `mpg` column in as the `trim` argument. If you pass the full dataset (as `.`) as an argument by itself, it will not be piped in as the first argument. If you modify it (e.g., by subsetting, slicing, or otherwise operating on the data), `magrittr` will still pass your data in as the first argument.

This following command will fail because the `.$mpg` is effectively being passed as the second argument, and `.` as the first. This doesn't make sense in the `mean` function.
```{r}
## Equivalent to mtcars %>% mean(., .$mpg)
## or mean(mtcars, mtcars$mpg)
mtcars %>% mean(.$mpg)
```

One solution would be to use `dplyr::pull` to extract one column from a data frame, and then pass that vector to the next function in the pipeline.

```{r}
mtcars %>% pull(mpg) %>%  mean()
```

However, `magrittr` has other pipes for such situations, which we will learn about in the next post...

(Spoiler: It's the `%$%` pipe! But there are others, and they're useful, too!)
