If you are developing websites in 2020 it is highly likely that NodeJS forms at least part of your toolchain. Whether you're developing on the backend or frontend, NodeJS plays an important part in the JavaScript ecosystem.

## The Problem

That being said, I have faced difficulties using NodeJS and the Node Package Manager (NPM) on Ubuntu, specifically relating to permissions. You can install `nodejs` and `npm` via `apt-get` as follows:

```bash
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
```

This does just fine if you want to create a new app and install packages in a local `node_modules` directory. However, I find that this breaks down if you want to install some packages globally on your system. Trying to run the following results in a failure to install due to permissions errors:

```bash
npm install -g hello-world-npm
```

You may see something like the following:

```
npm WARN checkPermissions Missing write access to /usr/local/lib/node_modules
npm ERR! code EACCES
npm ERR! syscall access
npm ERR! path /usr/local/lib/node_modules
npm ERR! errno -13

npm ERR!
npm ERR! If you believe this might be a permissions issue, please double-check the

```

The default install path for globally installed modules is `/usr/local/`. This can be verified by running:

```bash
npm config get prefix

# /usr/local
```

However, by default, NPM does not have the permissions to write files to that directory properly. You may be tempted to follow the error message's advice and re-run the install command as root/Administrator by re-running the command with `sudo`. I would recommend _against_ doing so. See [this article](https://medium.com/@ExplosionPills/dont-use-sudo-with-npm-still-66e609f5f92) about why you shouldn't install npm packages with `sudo`.

## A Solution

If we don't want to have to install our global packages with `sudo`, what's a dev to do? I found the most straightforward fix to be changing `npm`'s install prefix. This allows `npm` to install your packages in a directory that you have full control of. For example:

```bash
npm config set prefix "~/.npm-packages"
```

The next time you `npm install -g` a package, it will install into that directory instead of `/usr/local/`. You shouldn't have to use `sudo`, and all the permissions should be set correctly. Binaries will not yet be accessible on the commandline, however, because the `~/.npm-packages/bin` directory is not yet in your `PATH` variable. You will want to add the following line to your shell's startup script (e.g., .bash_profile, .zshenv, .profile, etc.) to ensure that binaries you've installed are available in your shell:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-packages/bin
```

## Another Solution

Global packages are often used for installing packages that you may want to call from your commandline, as opposed to code that is imported in your individual projects. For example, if you want to create a new react app, or use the AWS Amplify CLI, you will likely want to install these packages globally so that you have access to the binaries on your commandline.

If you are just testing out a new package or framework and want to run commands without permanently installing software on your system you can use the wonderful `npx` command. `npx` will let you run commands from NPM packages without having to install them on your system. If you want to create a new react app, you can do so without pre-installing any react packages:

```bash
npx create-react-app
```

If you will be running these commands frequently, you may want to permanently install the packags on your system so you don't need to download the files each time you run the command. If you're just trying out a new tool, though, `npx` is a simple way of getting the result you want without having to worry about installing anything.
