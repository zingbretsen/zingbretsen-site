# Embracing Vim Modes


As mentioned in <Link to='../vim-gives-you-superpowers'>this post</Link>, vim is a *modal* text editor. Pressing a key may trigger a diferent behavior depending on the current context. 

Just like when you're playing a video game, pressing the `w` key in the `normal` mode of your game may move you forward, but it probably won't enter a "w" into your game window. If you open a chat panel in the game, however, you will be able to enter characters at will. Then you can probably hit the `Escape` key and go back to moving around the in-game world.

This is *exactly* how vim works! There are modes for moving around your file, for entering commands, for selecting text, and (obviously) for inserting text.

## Insert Mode

The mode you may be most familiar with is called `insert mode`. This is how most other editors work all the time. In this mode, pressing the keys on your keyboard will enter that character into your document. This is obviously necessary to be able to do. You won't get very far if you can't actually enter text into your files.

Importantly, however, *this is not the mode that vim is in when you first open it*! Why is that?

When I am coding, I don't spend most of my time putting characters into the page. Most of my time is spent navigating around the page (or even different files), refactoring sections, moving code around, looking at documentation, etc.

Sure, in your normal editor you can use your arrow keys to move around, or `Page Down`/`Page Up` to jump over larger sections of your document. You can even use your mouse.

But you know what? You can do the same thing in vim while in insert mode. It's just not nearly the fastest way to move around.

## Normal Mode

`Normal mode` is the mode that vim starts in. Typing letters on your keyboard will not enter those characters into your document. Instead, the keys will do strange things like:

 - Move the cursor around the page in unexpected ways
 - Delete characters/words/lines from your document
 - Open a command console
 - Bring you into other modes, such as `insert mode`

There is a lot to say about this mode. It is the one you will likely spend the most time in, and there will be a whole other blog post devoted just to normal mode.

## Visual Mode

This is very simliar to normal mode, but it's all about selecting text. It will `visual`ly highlight the text that you have selected. The keybindings are all about changing what text you have selected or operating on the selection (e.g., `d`eleting that text, `c`hanging it, or `y`anking/`p`asting it).

You can press `v` to enter `v`isual mode or `V` to enter `V`isual line mode, where it will always select whole lines of text.

## Command-line Mode

Some video games also have a mode where you can enter commands into the game. For example, pressing `~` may open a console where you can type commands in, e.g., `noclip` to turn off collision detection, allowing you to walk through walls.

Vim has `command-line` mode, which lets you enter commands that will alter how vim behaves or run commands on text.
