We all struggle following through on personal projects sometimes. It can be hard to focus on the current task when the next fun idea presents itself.

Honestly, I think that's fine.

## Why work on personal projects

There are different reasons to work on personal projects. For me, the two biggest motivators are:

- To have the end result
- To learn new skills

Obviously, the reason I start some of my projects is because there is some end product that I would like to have. I may build a website, like this one, so that I can share content with other people.

What motivates me more, however, is using projects to learn new skills. I built this site to have a public-facing blog, yes. More importantly, I built it so that I could play around with JavaScript and static site generators. It will never be "finished". There will always be more posts to write and more features to add.

## What counts as "done"

In my opinion, it's fine to call a project done when it has accomplished its purpose. If that purpose is to gain an understanding of how a particular piece of technology operates, I won't lose any sleep if I didn't finish the product I had intended to create.

When I look back over my graveyard of half-finished projects, I see the tools and techniques I learned, not the apps that sit unused.

I've gotten exposure to a wide variety of topics, from web technologies to data science techniques. Some of these have proven to be useful at work (where I do actually finish projects, because that's the point).

I learn by doing, and I will continue starting more projects than I can finish. I think this makes me better at my job, and I also just find it more enjoyable.

I'm still hoping to finish that DAG-based todo list, though. One of these days...
